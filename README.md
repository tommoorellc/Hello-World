# Hello-World
Work related to intrabody imaging.
I have been working on minimally invasive ultrasound imaging since 1989.  The first intrabody ultrasound imaging devices that I worked on are called intravascular ultrasound (IVUS.)  Today intrabody imaging is used in the coronary arteries of the heart, the peripheral arteries and veins in the legs and Intracardiac ultrasound (ICE.)
